A card game where 2 players fight each other using cards representing microbes.

The game is meant for Introduction to Programming students at ETH as an alternative,
hopefully more interesting activity as opposed to the classic front-end exercise session.
Students are divided in small teams (2-4 people), each in charge of different parts of the system. Each team works separately but needs to coordinate with the other teams in such a way that the merged files will work together smoothly.

In the Merged folder you can find the current version of the game.
